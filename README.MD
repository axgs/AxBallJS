Classic 2D breakout game in vanilla javascript, early development stage.
GFX style like on the good old c64 homecomputer. Pixelratio 2:1. This is a little sparetime project.
<br><br>
game native resolution is: 320 x 200 pixel <br>
<br>
left/right cursor key to move the player <br>
space to release the ball <br>
<h1> Getting Started</h1>
ParcelJS will be used to bundle the files and to run a local webserver during development.<br>
(NodeJS installation is required).
<br>
<code>npm install</code> to install dependencies.<br><br>

`npm start` to start the local webserver. A message will apear on which port the webserver is listening.<br>
like <code>localhost:1234</code><br><br>
`npm build` to bundle the project in the `dist` folder. <br>
<br>
cheers.<br>
