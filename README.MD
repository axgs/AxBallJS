Classic 2D breakout game in vanilla javascript, early development stage.
GFX style like on the good old c64 homecomputer. Pixelratio 2:1. This is a little sparetime project.
<br><br>
game native resolution is: 320 x 200 pixel <br>
<br>
left/right cursor key to move the player <br>
space to release the ball <br>
<br>
I use parcel to bundle the files and to run a local webserver during development
(NodeJS installation is required).
<br>
`npm install` to install dependencies.<br>
`npm start` to start the local webserver.<br>
`npm build` to bundle the project in the `dist` folder. <br>
<br>
I make my pixel graphics with `aseprite`.
The levels will be created with `Tiled`.
<br><br>
cheers.<br>
